# Eth_Sign Verifier

Honestly, this is my first time writing eth_sign verification code. I've told everyone to move to personal_sign, ever since the community agreed it was more secure.

That said, a user made a claim on reddit with eth.sign, and when I fail to verify it, I can't help but think we just have crap tooling around eth.sign.

If you have good test inputs for geth's eth.sign, please add them to this repo so I can check my verification code against it.
